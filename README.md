    About the sistem.
    This system registers users on a form with validations and offers the option to upload a photo. Once saved, 
		the user will be added to a list of other users who have already been saved in the system. From there, there is
		the option to add a limited number of telephone numbers and emails for each user. It is possible to search 
		according to a user's first or last name, download images and generate a PDF with search results. An age comparison 
		chart is automatically generated with each new record saved.
